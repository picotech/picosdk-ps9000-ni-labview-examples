# picosdk-ps9000-ni-labview-examples

*picosdk-ps9000-ni-labview-examples* is a set of National Instruments LabVIEW examples demonstrating how to control the PicoScope® 9200 and PicoScope 9300 Series PC Sampling Oscilloscopes using ActiveX.

Examples are provided as a set of LabVIEW vi files and are grouped according to whether the oscilloscope is a PicoScope 9200 Series or 9300 Series model.

The example files use ActiveX to launch the appropriate *PicoScope9000* or *PicoSample* software application and run a presentation. The examples act as  ActiveX clients, while the corresponding *PicoScope9000* or *PicoSample* applications act as ActiveX servers.
